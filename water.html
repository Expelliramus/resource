Water is a clear, colorless, odorless, and tasteless liquid that is essential for all forms of life. It is composed of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen atom (H₂O). Water exists in three states: liquid, solid (ice), and gas (vapor). It is a universal solvent, plays a key role in various biological and chemical processes, and is vital for hydration, temperature regulation, and nutrient transport in living organisms.
